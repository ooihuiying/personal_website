              <br />
              <p> Hello, I am Hui Ying. I'm a Software engineer, earnest reader and writer with an overactive imagination. I am an avid runner and I enjoy
              being in nature!
              </p>
              <p>I have recently graduated from the National University of Singapore with a degree in Computer Science.</p>
              <p> I donâ€™t have the best language skills, but I do enjoy reading, writing and documenting things I have learned.
              The intention of this website is to serve as a repository of articles which i hope to write in the areas of topics that
              i am interested in. Prior to creating this website, most of my written works were published on my medium account: @liverungrow. I
              will continue to update both platforms so that it is easily accessible. </p>
              <p>I really hope you will enjoy my articles, have a nice day!</p>
